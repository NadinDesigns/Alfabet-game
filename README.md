# 🎯 Alphabet Game

An interactive mini-game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

### 🧩 Goal
Rearrange the letters into the correct alphabetical order (A → F).  
When the correct sequence is reached, a **victory sound** plays!

---

### ✨ Features

- Manual drag-like rearrangement by clicking individual letters
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Sound effects (click + win)
- Order verification after every move
- Fully built without any frameworks or libraries

---

### 🛠️ What I learned

This project helped me practice:

- DOM traversal and manipulation
- Event handling
- Array operations and comparison
- Debugging and code organization
- Writing reusable logic

---

### ✅ Why I’m proud of this project

> This is one of my first complete JavaScript DOM-interactive games.  
> I didn’t copy the instructor’s solution — I explored, got stuck, rewrote logic multiple times, and eventually made it work my way.  
> Now I understand **how to approach dynamic UI problems** and debug JavaScript confidently.
